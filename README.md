## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and configure the following environment variables:

    ```properties
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
    VITE_AUDD_API_KEY=<your_audd_api_key>
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `ml_service` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ml_service
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `ml_service` directory and configure the following environment variables:

    ```properties
    SERPAPI_API_KEY=<your_serpapi_api_key>
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
    GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your_spotify_client_id>
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_spotify_client_secret>
    SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:3000/spotify-callback
    ```
5. Run setup_nltk.py once to download NLTK data for Article Reading Function.
6. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Spotify Integration

The application now uses the Spotify Authorization Code Flow for authentication. There are two ways to connect your Spotify account:

#### Method 1: In-App Authentication (Recommended)
1. Start both the frontend and backend servers
2. Open the application in your browser
3. Navigate to the Music feature or Settings modal
4. Click "Connect Spotify Account"
5. Authorize the application in the Spotify popup
6. You're now ready to use Spotify features!

#### Method 2: CLI Script (Fallback)
If the in-app authentication doesn't work, you can use the CLI script:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run spotify:token
```

This will:
- Start a local server
- Open your browser to Spotify authorization
- Generate and save access/refresh tokens to your [.env](file:///Users/tr1la/Documents/LLMProj/LLM_application/frontend/.env) file

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `.gitignore` file excludes sensitive files like `.env` to prevent accidental commits.
- To test the application, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:8000` for the backend.
